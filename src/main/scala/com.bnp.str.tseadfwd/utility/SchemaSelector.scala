/**
 * A trait for defining and managing schemas for different data entities within the application.
 * This ensures that all data manipulations use consistent and structured data types across the application.
 *
 * Provides pre-defined schemas for entities like clients and orders,
 * which can be reused throughout the Spark application to maintain uniformity in data handling.
 *
 * ==Overview==
 * - '''clientsSchema''': Defines schema for client data including fields like clientId, name, and location.
 * - '''ordersSchema''': Defines schema for order data including fields like orderId, clientId, amount, and date.
 *
 * @note This schema definition module is designed and maintained by Mehdi TAJMOUATI, a Big Data/Cloud Trainer.
